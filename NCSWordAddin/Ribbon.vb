'TODO:  Follow these steps to enable the Ribbon (XML) item:

'1: Copy the following code block into the ThisAddin, ThisWorkbook, or ThisDocument class.

'Protected Overrides Function CreateRibbonExtensibilityObject() As Microsoft.Office.Core.IRibbonExtensibility
'    Return New Ribbon()
'End Function

'2. Create callback methods in the "Ribbon Callbacks" region of this class to handle user
'   actions, such as clicking a button. Note: if you have exported this Ribbon from the
'   Ribbon designer, move your code from the event handlers to the callback methods and
'   modify the code to work with the Ribbon extensibility (RibbonX) programming model.

'3. Assign attributes to the control tags in the Ribbon XML file to identify the appropriate callback methods in your code.

'For more information, see the Ribbon XML documentation in the Visual Studio Tools for Office Help.
